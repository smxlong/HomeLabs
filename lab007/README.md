# Lab 007: Multiple Lines of Code

### Points: 25

Let's make our program longer. Copy the `HelloWorld.java` file from Lab 005
into the Lab 007 directory, and make changes to it so that it prints out
the following output:

```
Hello, world!
Welcome to Lab007
Hello, world!
The next lab is Lab008
```

>NOTE: You'll need to change the `package` from `lab005` to `lab007` because,
>as you learned earlier, the package must match the name of the directory.
